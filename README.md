## Machine Learning Workflow üß†

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted in the `Project.ipynb` notebook.
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (`Employers_data.csv`), handling missing values and irrelevant columns.
- Performed exploratory data analysis using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to visualize distributions and relationships between features such as Age, Salary, Gender, Location, and more.

### 2. Model Building and Training

- Implemented in `salary_prediction_model.py`.
- Loaded and preprocessed data by encoding categorical variables and splitting into training and test sets.
- Trained multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- Evaluated models using R2 score to determine the best performing model.
- The best model achieved an R2 score of approximately 0.95, indicating high accuracy in salary prediction.
- Saved the best model (`best_salary_model.pkl`) and its accuracy metrics (`model_accuracy.json`).

### 3. Integration with Web Application

- The Flask app (`app.py`) loads the best trained model and accuracy data.
- Provides a web UI (`templates/index.html`) where users input employee details to get salary predictions.
- Displays the best model's accuracy score on the UI to build user trust.
- Additional pages provide salary trends, study recommendations, and career advice.
